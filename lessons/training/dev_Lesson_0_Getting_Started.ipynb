    "The calibration procedure relies on a python library named PyWrfHydroCalib, which explicitly handles the setup, model tuning, and provides diagnostics supporting the calibration process. This lesson is intended to provide a 10,000ft overview of the calibration process, system requirements, and workflow.\n",

    "# What Is It? Defining Key Terms:\n",
    "#### WRF-Hydro: \n",
    "An open-source community model, is used for a range of projects, including flash flood prediction, regional hydroclimate impacts assessment, seasonal forecasting of water resources, and land-atmosphere coupling studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The National Water Model (NWM):\n",
    "A joint development effort between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Water Prediction (OWP). The NWM is a set of operational analysis and forecast configurations of the WRF-Hydro modeling system (Gochis et al., 2013) which runs over the entire continental United States (https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyWrfHydroCalib:\n",
    "A robust workflow for calibrating parameters over individual basins occurred with a focus on automating the process for hundreds of forecast points in the NWM domain. This document set of exercises describe the various steps involved in setting up a WRF-Hydro calibration experiment, along with how to execute the calibration workflow and access the various results from it. This version of the calibration workflow has been designed to calibrate against observed streamflow. However, future iterations will expand the focus to calibrate against other observed hydrologic states, such as snow, inundation, and soil moisture.\n"

    "### Background Knowledge:\n",
    "Calibration is an advanced topic that goes beyond setting up the NWM or WRF-Hydro for a model simulation. Some understanding of the preparation of datasets, hydrologic parameters, and their associated impact on model states is needed. You will decide which parameters to calibrate, along with the proper ranges, domain size, and the length of the calibration simulation/evaluation period. It is highly encouraged that you run sensitivity analysis for the modeling domain to explore which parameters have significant impact on the modeled states being calibrated.\n",

    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "#### Python Packages:\n",
    "To run the calibration workflow, there are multiple software requirements and pre-processing steps that need to take place prior to actual calibration. Currently, the calibration workflow relies on a set of Python and R libraries to execute various functions and plotting capabilities. This is in addition to existing requirements to compile and run WRF-Hydro/NWM. As of early 2019, the calibration workflow code has been migrated from Python 2 to Python 3. The following Python libraries are used by the workflow:\n",
